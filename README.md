# COVID-19 Tweet Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset comprises tweets extracted from Twitter, with each tweet labeled with a sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:

UserName: The username of the Twitter user who posted the tweet.
ScreenName: The screen name of the Twitter user.
Location: The location associated with the user's account.
TweetAt: The timestamp of the tweet.
OriginalTweet: The original text of the tweet.
Sentiment: The sentiment label assigned to the tweet (positive, negative, neutral).
Project Goal

## The primary objective of this project is to:

Analyze Sentiment: Utilize NLP techniques to accurately classify the sentiment of COVID-19 related tweets.
Understand Public Opinion: Gain insights into public sentiment towards the pandemic, government responses, and other relevant topics.
Identify Trends: Track sentiment trends over time to identify potential shifts in public opinion.
Data Preprocessing

## The following preprocessing steps are applied to the dataset:

Cleaning: Remove noise, such as URLs, hashtags, and special characters.
Tokenization: Split tweets into individual words or tokens.
Normalization: Convert text to lowercase and apply stemming or lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text, such as sentiment-specific words or phrases.
Model Development

A machine learning model, such as a Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or a deep learning model like a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer, is trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict the sentiment of new tweets.

Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work

Potential future directions for this project include:

Advanced Sentiment Analysis: Explore more sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques, such as aspect-based sentiment analysis.
Topic Modeling: Identify the main topics discussed in the tweets.
Event Detection: Detect significant events and their impact on public sentiment.
Real-time Analysis: Implement a system to analyze tweets in real-time to provide up-to-date insights.
